Entorpy : in a column find the counts of every category and then iterate over each category:
	  Initial impurity is 1 and while iterating we will subract impurity from prob_of_label
	  FORMULA :: 
		     prob = counts[category] / (total_number_of_items_in_that_column)

		     IMPURITY -= prob^2

		return IMPUTRITY

INFORMATION GAIN: 
			MAIN NODE
			  /\
			 /  \
		       LEFT RIGHT
	FORMULA :: 
	
		prob_left = len(left) / (len(left) + len(right) ) 

		return entropy(MAIN_NODE) - (prob_left * entropy(left) + (1-prob_left)*entropy(right))
